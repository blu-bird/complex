# blu's complex analysis notes
These are notes for the FA21 MATH 2230 study group for complex analysis. These are intended as a summary of the material learned, and as a supplement to the material presented in Stein-Shakarchi and Ahlfors. 

## Complex Analysis
Complex analysis is a wonderful subfield of analysis and is useful for a lot of math/physics majors! It's relatively independent from the study of real analysis, and arguably (in my opinion) it's a lot more fun and elegant than its real counterpart! :)

This study group is doing a crash-course of the material, and so while we will try to hit a lot of the major results and theorems, we may not get to all of them! 

## Itinerary (subject to change)
### Week 0 - 12/22 - 12/26 (Ch 1.1-1.2 in S-S)
 - Preliminaries, familiarity with complex numbers
 - Limits and continuity
 - Holomorphicity, Cauchy-Riemann conditions
 - Power series, convergence
 - Analyticity and relation to holomorphicity
 - Branch cuts, argument function, logarithm

### Week 1: 12/26 - 1/2  (Ch 1.3 - Ch 2.4 (first part) in S-S)
 - contour integration
   - basics, look into line integration in R^n as analogy?
 - Cauchy-Goursat! + idea of the proof
 - Cauchy's Integral Formula (with derivatives)
 - Evaluation of real integrals

### Week 2: 1/2 - 1/9  (Ch 2.4 (second part) - Ch 3.1 in S-S)
 - Cauchy's Integral Formula (+ the many many consequences!)
   - Holomorphic functions are indefinitely diff'able
   - Liouville's Thm (entire + bounded -> constant) 
   - Analytic continuation 
 - Morera's Theorem 
 - Schwarz reflection, Runge approximation
 - Open Mapping Theorem, Maximum Modulus Principle
 - Singularities 

### Week 3: 1/9 - 1/16 (Ch 3.2 - Ch 3.6 in S-S)
 - Poles/essential singularities, Casorati-Weierstrass
 - Laurent series (in an exercise at the end of the chapter, should read more about them though!)
 - Residue formula/calculus 
 - Evaluation of real integrals Pt. II
   - Branch cuts (Log, with a capital L)
   - Evaluation of infinite series 
   - Jordan's Lemma
 - Argument principle 
 - Rouche's Theorem

### Week 4: 1/16 - 1/19 (tentative, choice from the following):
 - Fourier series/analysis (Book I of S-S is better)
 - Gamma and Zeta functions, Prime Number Theorem (Ch 6 - 7)
 - Riemann Mapping Theorem, conformal mapping (ch 8)
