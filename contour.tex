\section{Contour Integration}

Arguably, the most important parts of complex analysis address the integration of complex-valued functions along curves, especially holomorphic ones. We're going to use contour integrals to establish some deeper results about holomorphic functions, some of which might be extremely surprising!

\subsection{What is a Contour Integral?}
But first -- what is a contour integral? If you're familiar with integrating along curves in $\RR^2$, you won't be surprised to see that we do essentially the same thing in $\CC$.

First, what kinds of curves can we integrate along? We say $\gamma : [0,1] \to \CC$ is a smooth curve if


Like in single-variable calculus, we have a \textbf{Fundamental Theorem of Contour Integrals}, which is a complex version of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:
