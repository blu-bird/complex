\section{The Best Functions}

We begin our foray into complex analysis and start with a discussion of the smooth functions on $\CC$. We'll soon see that these are actually incredibly nice!

(For now, limits, continuity, topology are skipped in these notes

\subsection{Topology of the Complex Numbers}
It's literally just like $\RR^2$, consult Hubbard.
%% open disk/closed disk
%% open set
%% closed set
%% interior, limit points, closure, boundary 
%% compact
%% completeness

\subsection{Limits and Continuity}
It's literally just like $\RR^2$, consult Hubbard.
%% sequences, convergence of sequences
%% functions

\subsection{Holomorphicity}
We move to the notion of differentiability on $\CC$.

\begin{definition}
  Let $U$ be an open subset of $\CC$. A function $f : U \to \CC$ is \textbf{holomorphic} at $z_0 \in U$ if the limit $\lim_{z \to z_0} \frac{f(z) - f(z_0)}{z - z_0}$ exists. If it exists, the limit is denoted $f'(z_0)$, and is called the \textbf{derivative} of $f$ at $z_0$.
\end{definition}

Naturally, this definition of the derivative follows the
